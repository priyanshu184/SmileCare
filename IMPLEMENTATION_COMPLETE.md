## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Copy Model File to Project

The model file from `C:\Users\rites\Downloads\teeth_disease_model_resnet50 (1).h5` needs to be placed in the project:

```bash
# Copy to ml_service/models/
mkdir -p ml_service/models
cp "C:\Users\rites\Downloads\teeth_disease_model_resnet50 (1).h5" ml_service/models/teeth_disease_model_resnet50.h5
```

Folder structure should be:

```
ml_service/
├── models/
│   └── teeth_disease_model_resnet50.h5  ← Your model file
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt
└── .env
```

### Step 2: Install Python Dependencies

```bash
cd ml_service
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Required packages:**

- tensorflow
- flask
- flask-cors
- pillow
- numpy
- scikit-learn

### Step 3: Create ML Service .env

```bash
# ml_service/.env
FLASK_PORT=5000
MODEL_PATH=./models/teeth_disease_model_resnet50.h5
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

### Step 4: Start ML Service (Separate Terminal)

```bash
cd ml_service
python app.py
```

The ML service will start at `http://localhost:5000`

### Step 5: Start Development Server

```bash
# In main project directory
npm run dev
```

This starts:

- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend: `http://localhost:3000`

Visit `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Model not loading?

1. Check file path in `ml_service/.env`
2. Verify model file exists: `ml_service/models/teeth_disease_model_resnet50.h5`
3. Check TensorFlow is installed: `pip list | grep tensorflow`
4. Check Flask app logs for errors

### Port conflicts?

- Change FLASK_PORT in `.env` to unused port (e.g., 5001)
- Update ML_SERVICE_URL in main `.env` accordingly

### Geolocation not working?

- Enable HTTPS or use localhost (browser security)
- Allow location permission when prompted
- Check browser geolocation settings

### Images not uploading?

- Check file size (max 10MB)
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG
- Check browser console for errors

1. **ML Service**: Must be running separately from the main app
2. **Model File**: Place it in `ml_service/models/` directory
3. **Geolocation**: Works best with HTTPS or localhost
4. **Chat**: AI responses are keyword-based, not using ML model
5. **Calls**: Video/audio are UI simulations, not actual WebRTC
